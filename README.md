README
------

This is a misc repo. I'm actually running these scripts
on my "Linux debian 3.9-1-amd64 x86_64".

Include
-------

- Ncmpcpp config
- Mpd

Install
-------

After downloading and installing mpd and ncmpcc with:

	apt-get install mpd ncmpcpp

Create the following dirs:

	.mpd and .ncmpcpp/

Then you need to "touch" the following files into the mpd dir:

	mpd.db  mpd.log  mpd.pid  mpdstate  playlists

and then also put the "mpd.config" there.

Then you can copy the "config" file from ncmpcpp to your .ncmpcpp on your computer
